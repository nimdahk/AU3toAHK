This project is dead due to a lack of interest.

Former description:

This is a series of AutoHotkey scripts designed for use with AutoHotkey_L 1.1.07.03
It attempts to convert AU3 scripts to AHK ones.
Just like Wine can never run Windows programs perfectly, this project will never perform perfect conversions.
To use, drop an AU3 script onto the Parser.ahk file.
